OS-Simulation
=============

All the java files go into OS folder.

.class file will be ingored in this repo because we dont need to make changes to them, so any .class file wont appear on our repository. after cloning this repo, you need to manually put sos.class, jobtype.class and Format.class into your local directory for compiling and debugging purposes. cheers!
